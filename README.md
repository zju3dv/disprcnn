## Acknowledgment

This repo is built based on the Mask R-CNN implementation from [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark), and we also use the pretrained Stereo R-CNN weight from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rZ5AsMms7-oO-VfoNTAmBFOr8O2L0-xt/view?usp=sharing) for initialization.
The system architure figure is created with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), feel free to reuse our [project file](https://mega.nz/file/Z1xhFSwD#tCYwKCGNaquv1pH6bbYe0hf_7AIs3yd53jg6_z3f_CU)!
